    "Here we work with the Total Currently Positive (from Table A25 in the paper). The main idea is building a similarity matrix that records the similarity among a pair of regions with respect to an Italian COVID-19 data measure (in our case, the Total Currently Positive). The similarity is computed by applying the statistical test: the Wilcoxon Sum Rank Test. Therefore, the (i, j) value of the matrix represents the p-value of the Wilcoxon statistical test obtained by performing the test on the Total Currently Positive measures of region i with respect to region j. Using the similarity matrices, the networks can be built and analysed."
